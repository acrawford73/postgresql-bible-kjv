New,Colossians,1,3,Col1:3 ,"We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
New,Colossians,1,4,Col1:4 ,"Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,"
New,Colossians,1,5,Col1:5 ,"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;"

New,Colossians,2,18,Col2:18 ,"Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
New,Colossians,2,19,Col2:19 ,"And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God."
New,Colossians,2,20,Col2:20 ,"Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,"
New,Colossians,2,21,Col2:21 ,(Touch not; taste not; handle not;
New,Colossians,2,22,Col2:22 ,Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?

New,Colossians,3,7,Col3:7 ,"In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them."
New,Colossians,3,8,Col3:8 ,"But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."
New,Colossians,3,9,Col3:9 ,"Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;"
New,Colossians,3,10,Col3:10 ,"And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:"
New,Colossians,3,11,Col3:11 ,"Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all."
New,Colossians,3,12,Col3:12 ,"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;"
New,Colossians,3,13,Col3:13 ,"Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye."
New,Colossians,3,14,Col3:14 ,"And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness."

New,Colossians,3,21,Col3:21 ,"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
New,Colossians,3,22,Col3:22 ,"Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:"
New,Colossians,3,23,Col3:23 ,"And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;"
New,Colossians,3,24,Col3:24 ,Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
New,Colossians,3,25,Col3:25 ,But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
