New,2Timothy,1,4,2Tim1:4 ,"Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;"
New,2Timothy,1,5,2Tim1:5 ,"When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also."
New,2Timothy,1,6,2Tim1:6 ,"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands."
New,2Timothy,1,7,2Tim1:7 ,"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."
New,2Timothy,1,8,2Tim1:8 ,"Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;"
New,2Timothy,1,9,2Tim1:9 ,"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,"
New,2Timothy,1,10,2Tim1:10 ,"But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:"
New,2Timothy,1,11,2Tim1:11 ,"Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
New,2Timothy,1,12,2Tim1:12 ,"For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."

New,2Timothy,1,16,2Tim1:16 ,"The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:"
New,2Timothy,1,17,2Tim1:17 ,"But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me."
New,2Timothy,1,18,2Tim1:18 ,"The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well."

New,2Timothy,2,10,2Tim2:10 ,"Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
New,2Timothy,2,11,2Tim2:11 ,"It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:"
New,2Timothy,2,12,2Tim2:12 ,"If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:"
New,2Timothy,2,13,2Tim2:13 ,"If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself."
New,2Timothy,2,14,2Tim2:14 ,"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers."
New,2Timothy,2,15,2Tim2:15 ,"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
New,2Timothy,2,16,2Tim2:16 ,But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
New,2Timothy,2,17,2Tim2:17 ,And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
New,2Timothy,2,18,2Tim2:18 ,"Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."
New,2Timothy,2,19,2Tim2:19 ,"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."
New,2Timothy,2,20,2Tim2:20 ,"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour."

New,2Timothy,2,22,2Tim2:22 ,"Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
New,2Timothy,2,23,2Tim2:23 ,"But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes."

New,2Timothy,3,3,2Tim3:3 ,"Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,"
New,2Timothy,3,4,2Tim3:4 ,"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;"
New,2Timothy,3,5,2Tim3:5 ,"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away."
New,2Timothy,3,6,2Tim3:6 ,"For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,"
New,2Timothy,3,7,2Tim3:7 ,"Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
New,2Timothy,3,8,2Tim3:8 ,"Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith."

New,2Timothy,4,1,2Tim4:1 ,"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;"
New,2Timothy,4,2,2Tim4:2 ,"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine."
New,2Timothy,4,3,2Tim4:3 ,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;"

New,2Timothy,4,12,2Tim4:12 ,And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
New,2Timothy,4,13,2Tim4:13 ,"The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments."
New,2Timothy,4,14,2Tim4:14 ,Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
New,2Timothy,4,15,2Tim4:15 ,Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
New,2Timothy,4,16,2Tim4:16 ,"At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge."
