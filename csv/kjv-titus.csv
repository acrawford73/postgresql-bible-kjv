New,Titus,1,1,Titus1:1 ,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;"
New,Titus,1,2,Titus1:2 ,"In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;"
New,Titus,1,3,Titus1:3 ,"But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;"
New,Titus,1,4,Titus1:4 ,"To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour."
New,Titus,1,5,Titus1:5 ,"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:"
New,Titus,1,6,Titus1:6 ,"If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly."
New,Titus,1,7,Titus1:7 ,"For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;"

New,Titus,3,1,Titus3:1 ,"Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,"
New,Titus,3,2,Titus3:2 ,"To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men."
New,Titus,3,3,Titus3:3 ,"For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."
