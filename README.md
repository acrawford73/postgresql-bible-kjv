The Holy Bible (King James Version) for PostgreSQL

The repo comes with the following files:

Python script (kjv-psql.py), CSV files for each book of the Bible (created from XLSX files, exported as "CSV Comma Delimited")

The script will create a database called 'bible', create one table called 'kjv', then populate all 31102 verse in the KJV Bible.

Only Python version 2.7 has been tested.

To import the CSV files into your PostgreSQL instance run this command:

python kjv-psql.py

After import there should be 31102 verses stored. One Bible verse equals one record.
